# Deep Learning Architectures and Applications [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deep Learning Architectures and Applications [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-architectures-and-applications-video#?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789136814), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course presents deep learning architectures coded in Python using Keras, a modular neural network library that runs on top of either Google's TensorFlow or Lisa Lab's Theano backends. This video course introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that are used to reproduce synthetic data that looks like data generated by humans, and then teach how to forge the MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset with the help of Keras Adversarial GANs.

Practical applications include code for predicting the surrounding words given the current word, sentiment analysis, and synthetic generation of texts. We will learn about a specific form of word embedding word2vec. This embedding has proven more effective and has been widely adopted in the deep learning and NLP communities. We will also learn different ways in which you can generate your own embeddings in your Keras code.

By the end of this video course, you will be able to transform words in text into vector embeddings that retain the distributional semantics of the word.
